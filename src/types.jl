"""
Represents the layout configuration for a degree plan canvas, using vertical swimlanes to organize semester courses.

# Fields
- `lane_width::Number`: The height of a swimlane, containing the courses for a semester.
- `lane_height::Number`: The width of a swimlane, containing the courses for a semester.
- `x_inc::Number`: Small offset added to the x-coordinate for aligning course tiles within a lane.
- `x::Number`: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the first swimlane.
- `y::Number`: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the first swimlane, adjusted to accommodate a title tile.
- `sem_gap::Number`: The vertical distance between consecutive semester swimlanes.
- `year_gap::Number`: The vertical distance between the last semester lane of one year and the first semester lane of the next year.
- `tile_h::Number`: The height of individual course tiles within a swimlane.
- `tile_separator::Number`: The vertical distance between consecutive course tiles within the same swimlane.

# Description
`DPCanvas` provides the parameters needed to layout and render a degree plan flowchart. Vertical swimlanes represent semesters, with courses displayed as tiles inside these lanes. This structure ensures clarity in presenting the sequence and organization of courses across semesters and academic years.
